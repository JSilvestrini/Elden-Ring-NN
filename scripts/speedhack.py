"""
Highly based on the implementation of amacati at
https://github.com/amacati/SoulsGym/blob/master/soulsgym/core/speedhack/speedhack.py

Most code is nearly 1:1 besides some renaming of variables that make more sense to me.
This Github will be credited once again within the README.md.

Originally I was going to create this in C++ rather than python, but speed is
a nonissue in this case since this is done once at the start of the environment init
function and not called again.

The DLL that is injected was lifted from the same Github mentioned above since sometimes
you don't need to recreate the wheel. The general idea was to intercept the performance
counter and change the tick values in order to force the game to update more often.

Here is the cheat engine code that the above repo most likely based their DLL on:
